    There are fossils to be seen. But best to read up before hand so you have an
    idea where to look. Fossil Canyon is almost all trail. But not all smooth.
    There's a couple of places where you might have to use your arms to push or
    pull yourself up. It's about 5+ miles if done to the point where there's a
    main trail, more like a road that marks the end of the outbound journey. As
    for the return trip, I think it's best to make a right turn at the outer
    boundary. And then just hike along the ridge of the canyon you just exited.
    You'll have some great views of Red Rock and surrounding area. And in the
    spring, there's usually very nice cactus gardens along the ridge line. Other
    nice things about this hike are the fact that you don't have to enter the
    fee area. It is not in the Scenic Loop. It's across the street. It's also
    relatively quieter compared to other areas around Red Rock. It's a beautiful
    hike in its own way.

  <h2>Liberty Bell Arch Trail</h2>
  <p>
    This hike is actually located just across the state line in Arizona. It's
    about a 40 minute drive from the Las Vegas Strip. It's 6 miles all told if
    you follow it all the way from its origin to the Colorado River Overlook. It
    is totally worth it. The view of the river from the overlook is stunning.
    The hike itself is all trail. Although it's in the desert, there are some
    significant elevation changes. I highly recommend it for those in good
    hiking shape or gym shape.It's called the Liberty Bell Arch because at one
    point, about 2/3 of the wat to the Overlook, there is an arch in the rocks
    that has the very true shape of a bell. It's something to see. The signage
    isn't the best from what I can remember. Read up on it and pay attention out
    there. You should be fine.

  <h2>Hamblin Mountain</h2>
  <p>
    This 7.5 mile hike that originates around mile marker 18 along North Shore
    Road is my favorite hike. I've done it multiple times with multiple people.
    It's most trail hike that ascends at a reasonable grade. Although there are
    a couple of spots that you'll feel the burn. You wouldn't think that the
    open desert would be very scenic. But this hike will prove otherwise. And at
    the end, it opens up to a spectacular view of Lake Mead and surrounding
    parts. This is a hike where there's probably a 25% chance of seeing big horn
    sheep. And that is always a big plus. One thing to know, it is NOT an easy
    route to follow. It's best to go with someone who has been before. It's not
    hard to get lost. And it is very lonely out there.

  <h2>Desolation Canyon</h2>
  <p>
    This is a short, spectacular hike located in the Furnace Creek section of
    Death Valley. It is very close to Golden Canyon, a popular tourist hike. But
    Desolation Canyon is far more....desolated for lack of a better word. I
    learned of the hike through Jim Boone's Bird and Hike website. Thank you
    Jim!! It's a gem. There's about a mile of dirt rode to get to the trailhead.
    But any sedan in reasonable condition should make it no problem. It runs up
    through a very nice slot canyon with many tributaries(that usually dead end
    quickly). But keep following the main canyon until a trail starts on the
    right side that goes up and out of the canyon shortly before the canyon
    dead-ends. It will be a fairly steep climb out of the canyon. But it's just
    amazing to be up on top and have a look around. Bring a luch and just take
    it all in. I would guess 3-4 miles round trip. But I can't remember. I only
    remember that it's spectacular.

  <h2>Gray Cap</h2>
  <p>
    There are multiple routes to Gray Cap. BUT, no matter which route you do,
    you need to be in very good hiking shape!! The main ones originate from the
    Kraft Mountain Parking lot in the Calico Basin(not a fee area at this point
    in time). Jim Boone's route is a bit less technical and slightly longer than
    Branch Whitney's. I would definitely recommend Jim's route for intermediate
    or lower level hikers. It is more strenuous and less direct. But it's less
    dangerous and easier to follow. For those comfortable with Class 3+
    scrambling, Branch's route would be the more enjoyable one. And while the
    actual Peak is not the nicest, the views from the top and along the way are
    spectacular.

  <h2>Terrace Canyon</h2>
  <p>
    This a 6-7 mile hike that begins at the Pine Creek Trailhead in the Scenic
    Loop drive inside Red Rock National Conservation Area (there is a fee). It's
    the same trail head as Fern Canyon which is also on this list. Terrace
    Canyon is a longer, more of a grinding hike than Fern. But Terrace Canyon is
    porbably the nicest spot in Red Rock that I know. And that is saying
    something. It's a trail hike for the first probably 1.25 miles or so. Then,
    as you fork to the left of Mescalito and into Pine Creek Canyon, it becomes
    about bouldering. And finally, you'll make a left out of Pine Creek and then
    Gun Sight Canyon will be to the left (also nice, but not as nice) and
    Terrace Canyon to the right. Keep right and you end up in Utopia. This is a
    hike that I would definitely NOT recommend doing without someone who knows
    the route. Branch Whitney's writeup is very good. But still ...
